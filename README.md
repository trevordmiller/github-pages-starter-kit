## Getting Started

0. Install [Node + npm](https://nodejs.org/).
0. Download this project.
0. Run `npm install` and `bower install` to get dependencies.
0. Run `gulp serve`. This will run all of the gulp tasks (super fast), then run the jekyll build (takes a bit), then launch a live reloading BrowserSnc server for quick development. You may need to kill and re-run `gulp serve` if you add a new directory/file to the project.

Congrats! You have a running project ;)

#### Required Customizations

- `_config.yml`.
- Images and favicons in `public/src/images/`; I highly recommend using [realfavicongenerator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) as the `favicons` folder it gives you can completely replace the default `public/images/favicons` and the HTML is already in place; otherwise, you would need to tweak the `_includes/favicons.html`.
- Update the home page(`index.html`).
- Add/update other pages in `*/index.html` (including the default "About" page).
- Add/update components in `public/src/components/` which are imported into `main.js` and `main.scss` and liquid templates in pages, `_includes` and `_layouts` depending on the file type(s) used.

#### Optional Customizations

- Update the `README.md`.
- Add/update icons to `public/src/fonts/icomoon/fonts/*` and the related `$icons` Sass map in `public/src/components/icons/_icons.scss`.
- Google Webmaster verification: update and uncomment the related line in `_includes/head.html`. 
- Google analytics
	- add your `googleAnalyticsID` in `public/src/components/analytics/_analytics.js`
	- uncomment the import and init lines in `pulic/src/main.js`.
- If you want a custom domain, follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).
	1. Add a `CNAME` file to the project root with a single line: `www.yourdomain.com`.
	1. Change your `CNAME` record with your domain manager to point to `yourproject.github.io` so that going to `www.yourdomain.com` works.
	1. Changing/adding two A records to point to `192.30.252.153` and `192.30.252.154` so that going to `yourdomain.com` (no `www`) also works.
- If you want a blog, just add `.md` posts to the `_posts/` directory and they will show up at `/blog` See [Jekyll's docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) for more info and customizations.
